<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-In the early years of motoring, the Burma-Vita Company found a novel way to advertise its brushless shaving cream. Burma-Shave advertising signs, with their humorous, serial jingles, were spaced far apart on the roadside and made sense only to someone traveling at 35 miles per hour.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-1963 was the last year for the signs, most of which were repeats, including the final slogan, which had first appeared in 1953: Our fortune / Is your / Shaven face / It’s our best / Advertising space / Burma-Shave.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Philip Morris sold the Burma-Shave brand name to American Safety Razor Company in 1968, but the name remained dormant until 1997, when it was reintroduced for a line of shaving cream, razors, and accessories. EACH LINE WAS A SEPARATE SIGN, IN SEQUENTIAL ORDER, IN THE DIRECTION YOU WERE DRIVING.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Burma-Shave sign series appeared from 1925 to 1963 in all of the lower 48 states except for New Mexico, Arizona, Massachusetts, and Nevada. Four or five consecutive billboards would line highways, so they could be read sequentially by motorists driving by.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-For example: “DON’T PASS CARS/ON CURVE OR HILL/IF THE COPS DON’T GET YOU/ MORTICIANS WILL/BURMA-SHAVE.” Some slogans touted Burma-Shave as a pre-aerosol “brushless” shaving cream-a cream you could scoop out of a jar and lather onto your face without relying on an old-fashioned brush and moistened soap in a mug.

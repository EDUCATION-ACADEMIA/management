Social proof is a phenomenon where people follow and copy the actions of others in order to display accepted or correct behavior, based on the idea of normative social influence. This term was coined by Robert Cialdini, the same author who presented his six principles of persuasion.When we feel uncertain, we all tend to look to others for answers as to how we should behave, what we should think and what we should do. This psychological concept is known as social proof. It occurs as a result of our natural desire to behave in the correct manner and fit in with others.What is social proof? Social proof is a term that was coined back in 1984 by author Robert Cialdini in his book Influence. This phenomenon is also called informational social influence, and essentially its the idea that people copy the actions of others in an attempt to emulate behavior in certain situations.Social proof is the psychological and social phenomenom that our own behavior is impacted by the influence of the actions, attitudes, and beliefs of other people (online or in-person). Positive social proof can influence us to buy a new good or trust a business-while negative proof has quite the opposite effect.Examples: an Instagram post or tweet about your product by a celebrity or influencer. User: User social proof is when your current users recommend your products and services based on their experiences with your brand.

So yeah, SEM is a broad term that includes SEO and PPC. Which means that SEO falls under the umbrella category of SEM.The difference between search engine optimization (SEO) and search engine marketing (SEM) is that SEO focuses on getting traffic from organic search, whereas SEM focuses on getting traffic from organic and paid search. Both SEO and PPC are ways to market your business in search engines.The Difference Between Organic SEO and Local SEO Is in the User Intent. With organic search results, search engines show the websites that offer the most relevant and appealing content for a search query. This is the usual process for search engines regardless of whether a query is local or not.SEO is using non-paid tactics to drive traffic to your website organically. Its a slower process (usually three to six months) but can pay long-term dividends. SEM, including PPC, is the use of paid search platforms to drive targeted traffic to your website. It requires a budget but can drive results very quickly.The main difference between organic and local search is that local SEO has a geographical component and is part of Google Maps. If a user searches for an industry, topic, product, or service + location, the search engine knows that the search has local intent.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-SEO is where you focus 100% on ranking in the organic results. SEM is when you tap into both SEO and PPC in order to get traffic from search engines. So yeah, SEM is a broad term that includes SEO and PPC. Which means that SEO falls “under” the umbrella category of SEM.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The difference between search engine optimization (SEO) and search engine marketing (SEM) is that SEO focuses on getting traffic from organic search, whereas SEM focuses on getting traffic from organic and paid search. Both SEO and PPC are ways to market your business in search engines.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The Difference Between Organic SEO and Local SEO Is in the User Intent. With organic search results, search engines show the websites that offer the most relevant and appealing content for a search query. This is the usual process for search engines regardless of whether a query is local or not.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-SEO is using non-paid tactics to drive traffic to your website organically. It’s a slower process (usually three to six months) but can pay long-term dividends. SEM, including PPC, is the use of paid search platforms to drive targeted traffic to your website. It requires a budget but can drive results very quickly.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The main difference between organic and local search is that local SEO has a geographical component and is part of Google Maps. If a user searches for an industry, topic, product, or service + location, the search engine knows that the search has local intent.

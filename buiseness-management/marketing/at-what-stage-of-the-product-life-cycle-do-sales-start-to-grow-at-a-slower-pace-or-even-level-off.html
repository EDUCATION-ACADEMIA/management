<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The maturity stage is when the sales begin to level off from the rapid growth period. At this point, companies begin to reduce their prices so they can stay competitive amongst the growing competition.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Maturity Stage: During the maturity stage of the product life cycle, the sharp growth in sales begins to slow, and profits at the beginning of this stage decline. The most notable characteristic of this stage is the peaking of the product’s sales and profit curves.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Growth Stage. The usual characteristic of a successful new product is a gradual rise in its sales curve during the market development stage. At some point in this rise a marked increase in consumer demand occurs and sales take off.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Maturity: A period of a slowdown in sales growth because the product has achieved acceptance by most potential buyers. Profits stabilize or decline because of increased competition.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Many customers and potential customers have already purchased the product at this stage, so sales growth begins to slow. Revenue is increasing by this stage and a business would expect to be making a profit. Costs may decrease in the maturity phase as most people are aware of the product, so less promotion is required.

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The break-even point is the point at which total cost and total revenue are equal, meaning there is no loss or gain for your small business. In other words, you’ve reached the level of production at which the costs of production equals the revenues for a product.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-To calculate the break-even point in units use the formula: Break-Even point (units) = Fixed Costs ÷ (Sales price per unit – Variable costs per unit) or in sales dollars using the formula: Break-Even point (sales dollars) = Fixed Costs ÷ Contribution Margin.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-What is Break-even Point? Break-even point (BEP) is a term in accounting that refers to the situation where a company’s revenues and expenses were equal within a specific accounting period. It means that there were no net profits or no net losses for the company – it “broke even”.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Profit earned following your break even: Once your sales equal your fixed and variable costs, you have reached the break-even point, and the company will report a net profit or loss of $0. Any sales beyond that point contribute to your net profit.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The break-even point (BEP) in economics, business-and specifically cost accounting-is the point at which total cost and total revenue are equal, i.e. “even". There is no net loss or gain, and one has “broken even", though opportunity costs have been paid and capital has received the risk-adjusted, expected return.

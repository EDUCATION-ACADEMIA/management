<strong> It is generally recognised that one of the best ways to get an advertising message across is through word of mouth, that is, getting people to pass on the message to friends and family. Why is this such a successful way to get messages heard? 
</strong>
<p>(A) The message can be more complicated as you have experts to explain it. 
</p>
<p>(B) ** The message reaches lots of people fast and is more likely to be believed. 
</p>

</p>
<p>(D) The message keeps being passed on forever and so more people hear it.

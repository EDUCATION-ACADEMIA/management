The borrowing rate for real estate is more than the borrowing rates for autos, boats and VISA Reward Credit Cards.The APR can be referred to as a promised annual percentage rate. Although an APR is quoted on an annual basis, interest can be paid quarterly. Although an APR is quoted on an annual basis, interest can be paid monthly but never daily.Periodic rate is the rate charged by a lender each period. It can be quoted as a rate per period, say semiannually, per quarter or per month. For example, a bank could charge 1% per month for a credit card loan.Whats the difference?

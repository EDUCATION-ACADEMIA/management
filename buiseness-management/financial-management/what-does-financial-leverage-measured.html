<meta name="description" content="Answer: Financial leverage measures The sensibility of EPS with % change in the EBIT level. Explanation: The Financial Leverage (FL) measures the connection between the EBIT and the EPS and it mirrors the impact of progress in EBIT fair and square of EPS.The degree of financial leverage (DFL) measures the percentage change in EPS for a unit change in operating income, also known as earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). This ratio indicates that the higher the degree of financial leverage, the more volatile earnings will be.DFL determines the percentage change in a companys EPS per unit change in its EBIT. A companys DFL is calculated by dividing its percentage change in EPS by the percentage change in EBIT over a certain period. It can also be calculated by dividing a companys EBIT by its EBIT less interest expense.Financial leverage helps to examine the relationship between EBIT and EPS. Financial leverage measures the percentage of change in taxable income to the percentage change in EBIT. Financial leverage locates the correct profitable financial decision regarding capital structure of the company.The higher the degree of operating leverage (DOL), the more sensitive a companys earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) are to changes in sales, assuming all other variables remain constant. The DOL ratio helps analysts determine what the impact of any change in sales will be on the companys earnings.">

</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-DFL determines the percentage change in a company’s EPS per unit change in its EBIT. A company’s DFL is calculated by dividing its percentage change in EPS by the percentage change in EBIT over a certain period. It can also be calculated by dividing a company’s EBIT by its EBIT less interest expense.

It is used to calculate the net present value of future cash flows from a project and to compare this amount to the initial investment.Discount rates also reflect the opportunity cost of capital. The opportunity cost of capital is the expected financial return forgone by investing in a project rather than in comparable financial securities.Interest can be earned over time if the capital is received on the current date.

The term discount factor in financial modeling is most commonly used to compute the present value of future cash flows values. It is a weighting factor (or a decimal number) that is multiplied by the future cash flow to discount it to the present value.">

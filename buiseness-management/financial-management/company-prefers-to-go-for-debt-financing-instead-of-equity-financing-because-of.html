<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Many fast-growing companies would prefer to use debt to support their growth, rather than equity, because it is, arguably, a less expensive form of financing (i.e., the rate of growth of the business’s equity value is greater than the debt’s borrowing cost).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The main reason that companies choose to finance through debt rather than equity is to preserve company ownership. In equity financing, such as selling common and preferred shares, the investor retains an equity position in the business.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-One advantage of debt financing is that it allows a business to leverage a small amount of money into a much larger sum, enabling more rapid growth than might otherwise be possible. Another advantage is that the payments on the debt are generally tax-deductible.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Why is too much equity expensive? The Cost of Equity is generally higher than the Cost of Debt since equity investors take on more risk when purchasing a company’s stock as opposed to a company’s bond.

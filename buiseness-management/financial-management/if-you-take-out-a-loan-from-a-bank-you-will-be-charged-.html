<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: The answer is: b. for both principal and interest. As a borrower you have to pay the lender back both the amount that you borrowed (principal) as well as the cost of that money (interest).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Interest-When you take out a personal loan, you agree to repay your debt with interest, which is essentially the lender’s “charge” for allowing you to use their money, and repay it over time. You’ll pay a monthly interest charge in addition to the portion of your payment that goes toward reducing the principal.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The principal is the original loan amount not including any interest. For example, let’s suppose you purchase a $350, 000 home and put down $50, 000 in cash. That means you’re borrowing $300, 000 of principal from the lender, which you’ll need to pay back over the length of the loan.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Principal + Interest payments In a principal + interest loan, the principal (original amount borrowed) is divided into equal monthly amounts, and the interest (fee charged for borrowing) is calculated on the outstanding principal balance each month.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Principal is the money that you originally agreed to pay back. Interest is the cost of borrowing the principal.

<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-If nominal rate of return is 10% per annum and annual effective rate of interest is 10.25% per annum, The frequency of compounding is: 12 4 2 3.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In this question, the nominal interest rate is 16%, with quarterly compounding, interest compounds 4 times a year. Applying the formula, the effective annual rate is: (1+16%/4)4−1=16.99%
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:

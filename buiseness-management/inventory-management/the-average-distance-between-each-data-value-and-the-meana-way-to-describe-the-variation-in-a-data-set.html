<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The mean absolute deviation (MAD) is the mean (average) distance between each data value and the mean of the data set. It can be used to quantify the spread in the data set and also be helpful in answering statistical questions in the real world.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Mean absolute deviation describes variation in a data set and is the average distance between each data value and the mean. It can be calculated by finding the difference of each data value and the mean and then finding the average of that.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The mean absolute deviation (MAD), also referred to as the “mean deviation” or sometimes “average absolute deviation", is the mean of the data’s absolute deviations around the data’s mean: the average (absolute) distance from the mean.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a set of data is the average distance between each data value and the mean. The mean absolute deviation is the “average” of the “positive distances” of each point from the mean. The larger the MAD, the greater variability there is in the data (the data is more spread out).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Average absolute deviation is defined as the mean of absolute values of the deviations from the data set values. It is also known as the mean absolute deviation. It is one of the measures of central tendency among mean. median, mode and standard deviations.

Since 1955, Tax Day has typically fallen on or just after April 15. Tax Day was first introduced in 1913, when the Sixteenth Amendment was ratified.Taxes provide revenue for federal, local, and state governments to fund essential services--defense, highways, police, a justice system--that benefit all citizens, who could not provide such services very effectively for themselves.1862-President Lincoln signed into law a revenue-raising measure to help pay for Civil War expenses. The measure created a Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the nations first income tax. It levied a 3 percent tax on incomes between $600 and $10, 000 and a 5 percent tax on incomes of more than $10, 000.A tax return provides information so that the taxation authority can check on the taxpayers calculations, or can determine the amount of tax owed if the taxpayer is not required to calculate that amount.Tax Day is the due date for federal individual income tax returns and tax payments. For most taxpayers-in most years-federal income tax returns must be submitted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by April 15. This date applies to individuals who file taxes based on a calendar year.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Limited liability is important for companies, as it helps them raise money. With limited liability, investors only risk losing the money they have invested in shares. As a result, shareholders are more likely to invest in a company if they know they will not lose their personal assets.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Asset Protection The main advantage to an LLC is in the name: limited liability protection. Owners’ personal assets can be protected from business debts and lawsuits against the business when an owner uses an LLC to do business. An LLC can have one owner (known as a “member”) or many members.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The corporate form of organization offers several advantages, including limited liability for shareholders, greater access to financial resources, specialized management, and continuity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The big benefit is that it protects the individual partner’s assets and deems the LLP as a legal entity in its own right. The disadvantages are that the partnership needs to publicly disclose its financial details and there are fewer tax advantages compared to setting up an LLC.

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-In an organizational structure, “chain of command” refers to a company’s hierarchy of reporting relationships – from the bottom to the top of an organization, who must answer to whom. The chain of command not only establishes accountability, it lays out a company’s lines of authority and decision-making power.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The chain of command in a company refers to the different levels of command within the organization. It starts with the top position such as CEO or the business owner, all the way down to the front-line workers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Employees will generally report directly to those who are listed above them on the org chart, and the most popular, tried-and-tested way of building these reporting relationships is through a corporate chain of command, also known as the “hierarchical structure”.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The chain of command establishes authority and responsibility in an unbroken succession directly from one commander to an-other. The commander at each level responds to orders and directions received from a higher commander and, in turn, issues orders and gives directions to subordinates.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-How does a chain of command work? For one example, a chain of command might include an intern who reports to an employee who reports to their manager who reports to a senior manager who reports to the vice president of the company who then reports to the chief executive officer of the company.

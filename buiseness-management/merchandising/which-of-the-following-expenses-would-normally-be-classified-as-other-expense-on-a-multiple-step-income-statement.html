So, it would be recorded in the income statement under the heading non-operating expenses or other expenses and losses.When doing a multiple step income statement, one must remember the key elements. They are: Net Sales, Cost of Goods Sold, Gross Profit, Total Operating Expenses, net gain/loss from other activities, Income before taxes, Income tax expense, and Net Income.Other expenses are expenses that do not relate to a companys main business. As well as operating costs, the company needs to consider other expenses including interest expense and losses from disposing of fixed assets. Examples of other expenses include interest expense and losses from disposing of fixed assets.Other types of income that are commonly classified as other income are interest income, gains on the sale of assets, and gains from foreign exchange transactions.Most publicly-traded companies use multiple-step income statements, which categorize expenses as either direct costs (also known as non-operational costs), or indirect costs (also known as operational costs).">

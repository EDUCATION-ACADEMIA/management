<strong> In 1900, the average age of a person entering the labour force was 15. Today is has risen to 18. Why has this change taken place? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Kids today are not as bright as they were back then 
</p>
<p>(B) ** Once you had a job, you could stay with that company for life and progress through many levels of responsibility 
</p>
<p>(C) There were more educational opportunities post school, so everyone left to take them up. 
</p>
<p>(D) School was really boring back then. (of course, it is not now because you get to do quizziz!)

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Investors and the general public use the unemployment rate to understand the state of a county’s economy and as a measure of how well the government is running the country. A high unemployment rate means that the economy is not able to generate enough jobs for people seeking work.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The five effects of unemployment in India are: Unemployment increases the poverty rate and decreases the standard of public health. Increase in criminal activities can also be seen due to employment because they are unable to fulfil their needs. It also affects society and disturbs the economic balance of the country.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Unemployment results in reduced demand, consumption, and buying power, which in turn causes lower profits for businesses and leads to budget cuts and workforce reductions. It creates a cycle that goes on and on that is difficult to reverse without some type of intervention.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Up to 73 million US jobs will be lost to automation by 2030 That’s a considerable 46% of the current jobs, which means automation will no doubt shake up the nature of the job market.

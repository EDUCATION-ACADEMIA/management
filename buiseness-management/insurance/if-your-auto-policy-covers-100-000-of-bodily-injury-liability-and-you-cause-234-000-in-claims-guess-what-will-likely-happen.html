<strong>Concept note-1:

</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Your insurance provider is only liable for payment up to your policy limits. If a car accident victim sues you and receives a judgment for more than your car insurance policy limits, you are personally liable for the amount above your policy limits.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Bodily injury refers to specific kinds of harm done to the body after an incident, such as bruises, burns, cuts, fractured bones, and nerve damage. When someone carries bodily injury insurance, it covers the costs of the other person involved in the accident.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-You can be sued for the damages you caused that went beyond the coverage limits and can be forced to pay by the court, which could mean having future earnings garnished and personal property auctioned off to pay for the damage.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Blue chip players are those who have proven themselves to be among the best at their positions in their respective sports and are more sought after and wanted than other players. They are typically perceived as “can’t miss” prospects who are desired by most organizations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Put simply, to win the national championship, college football teams need to sign more four-and five-star recruits (AKA “Blue Chips”) than two-and three-star players over the previous four recruiting classes. This has been true basically as far back as modern internet recruiting rankings have existed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:

</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-People may demand high professional athlete salaries to ensure that they are able to put money aside to prepare for retirement, so they can care for themselves and their families after injuries and other adverse events.

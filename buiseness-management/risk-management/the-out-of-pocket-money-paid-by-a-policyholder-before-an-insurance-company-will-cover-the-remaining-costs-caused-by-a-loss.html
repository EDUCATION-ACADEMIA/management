<meta name="description" content="A mandatory out-of-pocket expense required by an insurance policy before an insurer will pay a claim is called a deductible (or if required by a health insurance policy, a copayment).An auto insurance deductible is what you pay out of pocket on a claim before your insurance covers the rest. Collision, comprehensive, uninsured motorist, and personal injury protection coverages all typically have a car insurance deductible. You typically have a choice between a low and high deductible.A deductible is the amount of money you need to pay before your insurance begins to pay according to the terms of your policy. An out-of-pocket maximum refers to the cap, or limit, on the amount of money you have to pay for covered services per plan year before your insurance covers 100% of the cost of services.The amount you pay for covered health care services before your insurance plan starts to pay. With a $2, 000 deductible, for example, you pay the first $2, 000 of covered services yourself. After you pay your deductible, you usually pay only a. copayment.Insurance companies use deductibles to ensure policyholders have skin in the game and will share the cost of any claims. Deductibles cushion against financial stress caused by catastrophic loss or an accumulation of small losses all at once for an insurer.">

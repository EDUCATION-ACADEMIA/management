<meta name="description" content="Natural hazards are severe and extreme weather and climate events. Although they occur in all parts of the world, some regions are more vulnerable to certain hazards than others. Natural hazards become disasters when peoples lives and livelihoods are destroyed.Earthquakes are one of the most unpredictable and damaging disasters. The scientific community has yet to find a way to predict when an earthquake will occur with enough time to evacuate areas. Systems exist, but they can only give a few minutes warning to residents that a disaster is on its way.A natural disaster is the negative impact following an actual occurrence of natural hazard in the event that it significantly harms a community. The National Risk Index is designed to help communities understand their relative natural hazard risk and the impacts they could expect during or after a disaster.We all know we cant predict when a natural disaster will occur. We also cant predict when man-made events such as an active shooter will take place. However, we can plan and prepare to respond to these types of events. We are continuously confronted with an ever changing landscape of disasters.Droughts, flash floods, cyclones, avalanches, landslides brought by torrential rains, and snowstorms pose the greatest threats. A natural disaster might be caused by earthquakes, flooding, volcanic eruption, landslides, hurricanes etc.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Natural hazards are severe and extreme weather and climate events. Although they occur in all parts of the world, some regions are more vulnerable to certain hazards than others. Natural hazards become disasters when people’s lives and livelihoods are destroyed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Earthquakes are one of the most unpredictable and damaging disasters. The scientific community has yet to find a way to predict when an earthquake will occur with enough time to evacuate areas. Systems exist, but they can only give a few minutes warning to residents that a disaster is on its way.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A natural disaster is the negative impact following an actual occurrence of natural hazard in the event that it significantly harms a community. The National Risk Index is designed to help communities understand their relative natural hazard risk and the impacts they could expect during or after a disaster.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-We all know we can’t predict when a natural disaster will occur. We also can’t predict when man-made events such as an active shooter will take place. However, we can plan and prepare to respond to these types of events. We are continuously confronted with an ever changing landscape of disasters.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Droughts, flash floods, cyclones, avalanches, landslides brought by torrential rains, and snowstorms pose the greatest threats. A natural disaster might be caused by earthquakes, flooding, volcanic eruption, landslides, hurricanes etc.

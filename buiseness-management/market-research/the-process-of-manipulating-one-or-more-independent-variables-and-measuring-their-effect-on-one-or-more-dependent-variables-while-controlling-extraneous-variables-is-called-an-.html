<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The experimental method features the manipulation of an independent variable, the measurement of a dependent variable, and control of extraneous variables.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The process of manipulating one or more independent variables and measuring their effect on one or more dependent variables while controlling for the extraneous variables is called an experiment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-There is an interaction effect (or just “interaction”) when the effect of one independent variable depends on the level of another. Although this might seem complicated, you already have an intuitive understanding of interactions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A manipulated variable, also known as an independent variable, is a part of an experiment that you can change to see how other variables respond. Here are the three types of variables in an experiment: Manipulated variable: The variable that you control and change based on the experiment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-An extraneous variable is eliminated, for example, if background noise that might reduce the audibility of speech is removed. Unknown extraneous variables can be controlled by randomization. Randomization ensures that the expected values of the extraneous variables are identical under different conditions.

Frame helps to identify everyone in the population so that everyone can get equal chance of selection for the study. Sample is the unit(s) where the researcher does his investigation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Many research studies require specific groups of interest to make decisions based on their findings. This group of interest is known as a sample.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The target population is the collection of elements or objects that possess the information sought by the researcher and about which inferences are to be made. The target population should be defined in terms of elements, sampling units, extent, and time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Sample = the selected elements (people or objects) chosen for participation in a study; people are referred to as subjects or participants. Sampling = the process of selecting a group of people, events, behaviors, or other elements with which to conduct a study.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:

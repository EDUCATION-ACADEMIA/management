<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Simple random sampling. In simple random sampling (SRS), each sampling unit of a population has an equal chance of being included in the sample. Consequently, each possible sample also has an equal chance of being selected. To select a simple random sample, you need to list all of the units in the survey population.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Simple random sampling is a type of probability sampling in which the researcher randomly selects a subset of participants from a population. Each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. Data is then collected from as large a percentage as possible of this random subset.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Systematic sampling is a probability sampling method in which a random sample from a larger population is selected. Stratified random sampling is a method of sampling that involves the division of a population into smaller groups known as strata.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Probability sampling is a technique in which researchers choose samples from a larger population based on the theory of probability. This sampling method considers every member of the population and forms samples based on a fixed process.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Random sampling is a method of choosing a sample of observations from a population to make assumptions about the population. It is also called probability sampling. The counterpart of this sampling is Non-probability sampling or Non-random sampling.
